# Template Dylint library

[Dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) is a tool for running Rust lints from dynamic libraries. This repository is a "blank slate" Dylint library.

You can fork this repository and edit it directly, or you can try the experimental `start_from_clippy_lint.sh` script described below.

**Experimental**

Choose a [Clippy lint](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/) and run the following two commands:

```sh
./start_from_clippy_lint.sh CLIPPY_LINT_NAME
cargo build
```

If the first command fails: sorry. Perhaps try another Clippy lint.

If the first command succeeds, but the second fails: you are probably halfway to having a functional Dylint library.

If both commands succeed: hooray! You might then try the following:

```sh
cargo dylint CLIPPY_LINT_NAME -- --manifest-path=PATH_TO_OTHER_PACKAGES_MANIFEST
```
